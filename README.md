## Project Description

While RNA-targeting strategies are powerful tools for disease therapy, challenges, including low target engagement and off-target collateral effects, currently limit their efficacy. Here, we report the engineering and optimisation of a CRISPR/dCas13 RNA steric blocker (CRISPR-Lock) that prevents mRNA translation, shields mRNAs from miRNA-mediated silencing, and blocks RNA-protein interactions. By tuning the spatial resolution and mismatch tolerance of CRISPR-Lock, we develop a high-resolution perturbation approach that employs genetically encoded CRISPR-Lock as a miRNA target protector. This system enables precise spatiotemporal control of miRNA:mRNA interactions, offering broader applicability compared to phosphorodiamidate morpholino (PMO) target protectors. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential therapeutic application of CRISPR-Lock for blocking pathological RNA-protein interactions in type 1 myotonic dystrophy (DM1). Optimising CRISPR-Lock to target expanded repeat RNAs corrects approximately 85% of clinically relevant splicing biomarkers in patient-derived myotubes and significantly outperforms third-generation PMO antisense oligonucleotides. Finally, by delivering a miniaturised AAV-encoded CRISPR-Lock system into an established DM1 mouse model, we demonstrate the dose-dependent correction of intranuclear foci and splicing dysregulation, underscoring the potential therapeutic application of this technology.
